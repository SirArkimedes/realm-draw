# Release 3.9.13

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* Added `enableDebugMode` option to KubernetesSyncWorker

### Internals
* Upgraded sync server to 3.8.13
  * [3.8.10] Fixed distinct queries with partial sync (broken in 3.6.0).
  * [3.8.10] Exposed SSL-related configuration options in the Node.js API.
  * [3.8.11] Improved `realm-stat` command line tool. Extra robustness, and now also
    revealing history type and history schema version.
  * [3.8.12] Fix not flowing endpoint and SSL settings from the CLI to the runtime
    configuration in the Node.js server binding.
  * [3.8.13] NodeJS package now allows catching fatal errors from the sync server binding,
    using the `errorCallback` configuration option.
  * [3.8.13] NodeJS binding is now bundled with both release and debug builds. The build can
    be chosen at runtime using the new `enableDebugMode` option to RealmSyncServer.

# Release 3.9.12

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* None

# Release 3.9.10

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a failure in the `PrometheusStatsStorage` where url creation threw an error when running on Node.js v6.

### Enhancements
* The server can now be started with a `StatsdStatsSink` as `StatsSink`.
  When doing this any statistics captured by the server and its sync workers will be send as UDP packets to a predefined
  UDP socket. This enables a better integration into environments where statistics are aggregated via StatsD.
* [Sync] Added more logging around the detection of invalid partial realms about to be renamed as "inconsistent". The error causing the inconsistency was previously swallowed.
* [Sync] Fixed a bug which could result in memory corruption and crashes.

### Internals

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals

# Release 3.9.6

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* `PrometheusStatsStorage` implements the `StatsStorage` interface and allows admin users to query instant values
  statistics through the `/stats/instant` endpoint, when ROS is running with the `PrometheusStatsSink`.

# Release 3.9.5

### Bugs fixed
* Updated to Sync 3.8.5
  * Fixed a bug that would result in the server crashing with `std::bad_alloc` in the error message.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* None

# Release 3.9.4

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* ROS can now be started with an option (--realm-size-reporting when started on the CLI and `enableRealmSizeReporting`
  when starting the server programmatically) to periodically (currently every 30 minutes) emit stats about the size of
  the data of realms stored on the server. These can be read by admin users via a new `/stats/instant/{metricName}` HTTP
  endpoint.
* Update to Sync 3.8.4.
  * Improved the average memory usage during merge.
  * Fixed another memory bug related to stray iterators while iterating in the merge algorithm, which could lead to memory corruption, changeset corruption, and crash the server/client.
  * Optimized ChangesetIndex when merging changesets that mention a large number of objects.

### Internals
* None

# Release 3.9.3

### Bugs fixed
* ROS will no longer initialize new projects with the latest version of ROS by default.
Instead, it will use the version of the globally installed package. If you want to initialize
a project with the latest version of ROS, you can use `ros init my-project --latest`.

### Enhancements
* Allow `ros init` to be run without an argument from an empty folder. In this case, it will
initialize the project in the current folder.

### Internals
* Accept sync server metric `connection.term.superseded_session`.
* Add `ros_sync_conn_term_superseded_session` graph to
  `helm/realm-object-server/grafana/dashboards/realm-object-server-stats.json`.
* Further improve CPU and memory utilization graphs in
  `helm/realm-object-server/grafana/dashboards/realm-object-server-stats.json`.
* Updated sync to version 3.8.1:
  * Updated Core dependency to 5.7.2.
  * Several bugs have been fixed in the merge algorithm that could lead to memory corruption and crash the server with errors like "bad changeset" and "unreachable code".
  * It is made possible to start a new HTTP request in the completion handler for the previous HTTP response.
  * A client session could get enlisted to send while it was already enlisted to send (request REFRESH message before reception of IDENT message).
  * Make it possible to use util::make_thread_exec_guard() without a stoppable parent.
  * Sync server now logs a message at info level when it is shut down gracefully. The message is Realm sync server stopped.
  * Detect violations of the "no merge during partial synchronization" invariant.
  * When integration of an uploaded changeset fails, log enough information about the failure to allow the failure to be reproduced using a copy of the target Realm file plus the realm-merge-changeset-into-realm command line tool.
# Release 3.9.2

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* Added two parameters - `shouldCompactRealmsAtStart` and `shouldPerformPartialSyncAtStart`
  that control whether the server will compact the Realms and do a complete partial sync
  during initialization. Compacting the Realms may reduce the disk space they use, while
  performing partial sync will detect inconsistencies in the partial Realms and correct them
  at the cost of incurring a client reset for the clients that used to synchronize against
  an inconsistent Realm. It is recommended that they are set to `false` (or left undefined)
  unless you are experiencing Bad Changeset errors or excessive disk usage.

### Internals
* Updated dependencies to non-deprecated versions.
* Updated to Sync 3.8.0.

# Release 3.9.1

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Upgrade to realm-sync 3.7.0.
  * Improved performance of creating objects with string primary keys.
  * After performing partial synchronization, activate backup after any change in a Realm file, not just when a new history entry is added.
  * Query-based sync has been greatly optimized, and should be faster under almost all workloads.
  * Improved the performance of setting a link to its current value.
  * Improved the performance of very large transactions, e.g. ones created by the SQL loaders.

# Release 3.9.0

### Enhancements
* Added an optional `allowAnonymous` argument to route decorators. If not specified on the route level,
  the service-level value will be used. To specify it for individual route, use the following syntax:

  ```ts
  @Get("/some-path", /* allowAnonymous */ true)
  public unauthorizedFunction() {}
  ```

  The route-level value, if specified, will override the service-level value. To specify it at the service level,
  use the following syntax:

  ```ts
  @BaseRoute("/my-service", /* allowAnonymous */ false)
  export class MyUnauthorizedService {}
  ```

  The default value for the service decorator is `true`, meaning ROS will not enforce authorization requirements by
  default.

### Internals
* Expose a config option in the HealthService to allow it to mark its traffic as ignored.
* Don't automatically add `__admin` to internal identities.

### Breaking changes
* When an authorization header is not specified, the HTTP response will now be `401 Unauthorized` rather than
`403 Forbidden`.
# Release 3.8.1

### Bugs fixed
* The PermissionsService will wait for the wildcard permissions Realms to be created.

### Enhancements
* Exclude internal traffic (e.g. ROS-to-ROS or health checks on Cloud) from traffic metrics.

* None

# Release 3.7.0

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* Added `historyTtl` and `historyCompactionInterval` options to KubernetesSyncWorker
* An endpoint for compacting all Realms on the sync server.  A POST request to
  "/realms/compact" with an admin user token will make ROS connect to all
  backend sync servers and send them a "/api/compact" HTTP request that
  instructs them to compact all Realms.

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* Exposed history log compaction configuration options. The BasicServer config object now has `historyTtl`
property to configure the time after which history entries will expire and be eligible for compaction (default
is infinite). The `SyncService` configuration object has that as well as `historyCompactionInterval` (to control
at what intervals the compaction algorithm will be run, default 3600) and `enableLogCompaction` (to disable the
algorithm altogether, default is enabled).

### Internals
* None

# Release 3.6.5

### Bugs fixed
* `RealmDirectoryService` will initialize the Default Realm only once. This prevents extensively long ROS startup times
when the default Realm contains a lot of data.

# Release 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes
* Using realm-sync 3.0 with protocol breaking changes. This release is protocol backwards compatible
  with existing SDKs when syncing "full-realm" Realms, but requires the following versions when using partial sync:
  - Java: 5.0.0
  - Cocoa: 3.2.0
  - Javascript: 2.3.0
  - .NET: 2.2.0 - will be released soon.
* `SyncService`'s `dataPath` configuration property is now deprecated and will be removed in a
  future version. The current default value of './sync' (relative to the server's `dataPath`)
  will be used after the removal.
* A new default realm is created by the server and given the
  sync path "/default". The default Realm only contains a schema
  version right now. Later it will contain the data currently in
  the admin Realm and other internal Realms.
* Server Realms are grouped into three types: "full-realm", "reference-realm",
  and "partial-realm". The realm type is stored in a new column in the admin Realm.
  "full-realm" realms can be used for full sync. "reference-realm" realms
  are used for partial sync. Queries are made in "reference-realm" realms.
  "partial-realm" realms are used by clients that connect to partial sync
  and have urls containing "__partial".
* A permission system is made for the three types of Realms.
  * Full realms have the standard permission system and a non-admin user only
    has access to its own Realms or Reams with explicit permissions.
  * Reference Realms are freely accessible by everybody. Object level permissions
    will take care of restricting access.
  * Partial Realms are individual and can only be used by the owner.
* A Reference Realm is made automatically when partial sync is started with a new
  url. A user can only create a new reference Realm in its own
  directory. An admin user can create arbitrary reference Realms.
* A realm can never switch type. It is not allowed to perform partial sync with a
  "full-realm" Realm. It is allowed for an admin user to perform full sync with
  a reference realm.
* The default Realm has type "reference-realm" and can be used for partial sync by
  everybody out of the box.

### Bugs fixed
* The JWT auth provider error messages will now correctly serialize the rejection reason.

### Enhancements
* Added `emailHandlerConfig` to the `PasswordAuthProviderConfig` to use a nodemailer to send password reset and email confirmation emails.
* Added UI for email confirmation and password reset on /confirm-email and /reset-password respectively.
* A new default realm is created by the server and given the
  sync path "/default". The default Realm only contains a schema
  version right now. Later it will contain the data currently in
  the admin Realm and other internal Realms.

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.8.2

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements

* The proxy logs the number of open connections to the sync server.
* Added the ability to specify a custom Authorization header name for incoming HTTP requests.
* Add retry logic when internally accessing services in case some services are behind
  a proprietary HTTP proxy that doesn't start proxying incoming requests right away.
* Added an overwrite option for the backup to specify that the destination
  directory may be overwritten

### Internals
* The terms of service agreement is only shown when the ROS command line
  program is used to start the server, and not for init, backup, and migration.

### Internals

### Enhancements
* Added `emailHandler` property on the `PasswordAuthProvider` config object. Set that to receive callbacks
whenever a user requests a password reset.
* A new token, called UserToken, that will be used by partial
  sync. The user token has this form
    {
        "app_id":"io.realm.Auth",
        "identity":"ecd6649d80c7ad8d0e2d29fa94268d06",
        "salt":"bb4522fa",
        "expires":1516373219,
        "is_admin":false
    }
  A user token is obtained by sending a refresh token to /auth without "path"
  in the body of the request.
* A new API has been exposed to enable, disable, and configure authentication providers at runtime. It is currently limited
to the built-in providers.

### Internals

# Release 2.6.0

### Breaking changes
* The `DELETE auth/user/:userId` endpoint is now deprecated and will be removed at a later version. Instead use
`DELETE auth/users/:userId` (`user` is now plural - `users` to align with the other endpoints mounted on `auth`).

### Bugs fixed
* In clustered scenarios, `/health` should report the overall health of the cluster. If interested in
the health of a single instance, pass `?thisInstance=true` as query string.

### Enhancements
* Expose configuration options for the JWT Auth Provider to allow customizing the names of the `userId` and `isAdmin` fields.
* Adds an optional `requiredAttributes` option to the JWT Auth Provider, allowing filtering of JWT tokens.
* Adds an optional `providerName` option to the JWT Auth Provider, allowing the provider to be enabled under different names.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Re-enabled https tests in realmjs-integration
* Added new lint rule: no-trailing-whitespace

# Release 2.5.0

### Breaking changes
* Some methods and properties that are considered internal API have been marked private. This will show
up as compilation errors for typescript projects where they are accessed. While their usage is discouraged,
you can temporarily silence the errors by using the bracket notation. For example, `server.realmFactory.open`
can now be invoked by replacing it with `server['realmFactory'].open()`. Ultimately, you should move your
project to use only the public API.
* The following classes have been renamed:
  * `Console` -> `ConsoleLogger`
  * `File` -> `FileLogger`
  * `FileConsole` -> `FileConsoleLogger`
  * `AzureAuthServiceConfig` -> `AzureAuthProviderConfig`
  * `CloudkitAuthProviderParams` -> `CloudkitAuthProviderConfig`
  * `GoogleAuthServiceConfig` -> `GoogleAuthProviderConfig`
  * `PasswordAuthParams` -> `PasswordAuthProviderConfig`
  * `Mute` -> `MuteLogger`
  * `ServerStartParams` -> `ServerConfig`

### Bugs fixed
* Tokens without expiration date can now be revoked.
* Admin.json will now correctly be written, even if you provide custom private and public keys.

### Enhancements
* Expected HTTP access log entries are now logged on the "debug" level to avoid flooding the "info" log level.
HTTP responses with status code 400 or above are now logged on "detail" level.
This silence the verbose "GET /healthz HTTP/1.1 200" entries.
* Expose a configuration option - `writeAdminTokenToJson` on `ServerConfig` that controls whether the admin token
will be written to `data/keys/admin.json`.

* Expose `jsonBodyLimit` in the `ServerConfig` interface to allow increasing the maximum request size.

### Internals
* Added basic performance tests for the password provider.
* Added tests that fails if fatals, errors or warnings are logged during startup and shutdown.
* Added a `test:watch` script that allows watching for file changes and running the tests with coverage.
* RealmFactory.ts now warns if all realms open was not closed before closing the factory.
* Added Typescript interfaces for service types
* Added Histogram StatsSink metric type
* Now tracking sync proxy connection durations with StatsSink

# Release 2.4.2

### Breaking changes

### Bugs fixed
* Export the JWT provider

### Enhancements
* Export stats classes and interfaces

### Internals
* Require labelNames in StatsSink metrics, which is needed for a downstream feature
* Allow configuring of a server's statsSink and statsStorage components.
* Changes the publish process to save a release notes file for later use (making a github release).
* Enabled module name case checks in tsconfig to prevent from hidden errors
  caused by case-sensitivity.
* Use && to chain commands in the build command line. This allows it to report
  failure on any step, not just the last one.

# Release 2.1.1

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed an import statement to make it work on case-sensitive file systems (Linux).
* Fixed a bug rendering `ros backup` useless because of incomplete path
  resolution for `realm-backup`.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Added a new start parameter for the server to enable tweaking the generated
  crypto key length. Reduced the crypto key length in tests to avoid timing out.

# Release 2.1.0

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The LogService will now respect token revocations (#735)
* Revoked tokens will now never be assigned to the req.authToken.

# Release 2.0.23

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixes MixpanelService issue for Enterprise where some stats might not be available until
  the sync proxy is fully running.

### Enhancements
* Added JWT authentication provider. It allows you to create a custom
  authentication service that issues signed Json Web Tokens that contain a
  `userId` and optional `isAdmin` fields. The app then transmits the token to
  ROS which verifies the signature and authenticates a user with the provided
  `userId`.

### Internals
* Deleting a Realm that is required for ROS to function is now rejected (#737 fixing #734).
* Fixed a race condition in permission tests causing it to fail consistently
  on slow machines.
* Discovery tags for sync now use a descriptor, e.g., role=master or label=default.

# Release 2.0.22

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The health service no longer responds with 200 OK unless the server has fully
  started. It is 503 in case the server is still loading.
* The admin token user can now apply permission changes successfully.
* The early log messages do not get skipped in Studio any more.
* Users now have read-write access to their `/~/__permission` realms (again).
  The recent switch to read-only was an unintended breaking change.
* Fixed a potential race in the permission service. It reported itself started
  before setting up all the listeners and granting default permissions.
* [Object Server] Fixed a bug where deleted-then-recreated objects with identical
  primary keys become empty.
* [Object Server] Fixed a bug in outward partial sync to ensure
  convergence of partial sync in the case where the client creates a primary key object, that is already present on the server, and subscribes to it in the same transaction.
* Added error handling to the internal requests to the load balancer. This
  should fix some unhandled promise rejections.

### Enhancements
* TypeScript and JavaScript templates now have .gitignore

### Internals
* The logger will now accumulate early log messages until a listener
  (i.e. the LogService) is attached. Or it will explicitly say that they had
  to be skipped, in case the listener didn't attach for a very long time.
* ROS will grant read-write permissions on `/~/__permission` to all users upon
  startup.
* Updated realm-js to 2.0.11 ans Sync to 2.1.7
# Release 2.0.21

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Close all Permission Realm files used to avoid running out of file handles.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.20

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Welcome static files are now served with `ros init`

### Enhancements
* Spinner is included during dependencies installation of `ros init`

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.18

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Realms with invalid paths are now rejected. Previously ROS would just create
  unsyncable realms.
* Realms with invalid paths are now skipped during 1-to-2 migration. This is
  required because ROS-1 has the same behavior creating unsyncable realms, which
  we are not going to fix.
* Non-existent data files are not copied during 1-to-2 migration.
* The default port for BasicServer's https is now properly set to 9443
* HTTPS key and cert are now validated before attempting to start
* server.shutdown() is now more forgiving in failed state scenarios

### Enhancements
* Server now has a simple method called `openRealm` that takes a remote path, like `/__admin` for example. This is always opened up with the internal server admin user. The schema is optional.

### Internals
* Release process now removes the internal release notes from public releases.  If it works, this line
  will not show up on https://github.com/realm/realm-object-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

# Release 2.0.17

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The migration tool now also migrates global realms.
* The default port for BasicServer's https is now properly set to 9443

### Enhancements
* There are two new special realms where permissions are reflected.
  `/<userid>/__perm` contains user-specific permissions and `/__perm` contains
  wildcard permissions. The old special realms are still available and reflect
  the same permissions, but they might contain duplicates. They are only there
  for compatibility and will be removed in the future.
* `ros migrate` will copy realm files by default. Specify `--norealms` to disable that.
* Added notice to users about the long time 'ros init' can take.
* Updated realm-js to version 2.0.5

### Internals
* The user-specific permissions are now also reflected into `/<userid>/__perm`.
  The difference from `/<userid>/__permission` is that `__perm` has a primary
  key, which allows the merge algorithm to eliminate duplicates. The same
  changes were made to wildcard permission realm: the new version with primary
  key is `/__perm`. The old paths are still accessible and will contain
  duplicates as before. This was also a chance to name those realms
  consistently, which we did. So, the mapping from old to new is:
    `/<userid>/__permission` -> `/<userid>/__perm`
    `/__wildcardpermissions` -> `/__perm`
* Assert in Realm deletion unit test.
* Expose maxDownloadSize as a parameter to the server.

# Release 2.0.16

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a problem in the install script where nvm is installed by homebrew.
* Added note to install script reminding the user to use the correct Node.js version.
* Fixed an issue with exporting all custom realm symbols
* Added support Visual Studio Code debugging and running when generating a server setup with `ros init`
* Opening a partially synced Realm before the master Realm was created now works correctly
* Terms of service is now persisted under the user's home directory. Fixes \#550

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Updated the TS and JS templates to be easier to modify.
* Terms of service now generates a distinctId as a UUID and uses that in all mixpanel events. Fixes \#600
* Adding Mixpanel Usage Stats with Incremental timer
* Adds simple stats collection interfaces, loosely matching that of prom-client, a Prometheus stats
  emitter. In developer edition, metrics are stored in-memory, allowing mixpanel to access them.
* Adds ROS usage by emitting to mixpanel data about the connections that go through the SyncProxyService
* Exposes mix panel interface by gating it behind setting a distinctId. This is typically loaded from
  the agreement file.
* Created a MixpanelService which handles emitting stats periodically to mixpanel.


# Release 2.0.15

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a bug preventing from migrating from ROS1 when `cluster_node_id` is
* Fixed a bug in SingleProcessDiscovery where find by tag returned unexpected
  results
* Fixed a bug in PermissionService where the listeners could potentially
  operate on missing or invalidated objects
* Return a proper error when using the admin token to make permission changes
  where the userId might not exist.
* Made sure that all symbols in `./realms/**/*.ts` are now exported

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals

* THe 1-to-2 migration now checks that the destination directory is empty and
  fails with a message about that if it is not an empty dir.
* Expose the ROS port on the Docker container, to work with `docker run -P` for exposing on a random port.

### Internals

# Release 2.0.12

### Breaking changes

### Bugs fixed
* The LogService WebSocket endpoints now needs an authentication message with a valid access or refresh token, within
  the first second of connecting to them. Realm Studio sends this message starting from v1.3.0.

* Fixed bug in CloudKit auth provider: https://github.com/realm/realm-object-server/issues/282
* Make releases on public repo
* Update private repository name
* New changelog workflow

## 2.0.7

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed several possible race conditions during server start and stop.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Introduces a timeout function which will race a regular promise. This is crucial for avoiding deadlocks in service requests.
* SyncProxyService now uses a shared cache of backend promises, creating less work when multiple connections for the same realm happen at the same time. Also avoids race conditions in this case.
* Introduced a RealmFactory class which can provide access to Realms on backend sync workers. This is now separated from the Server class.
* Introduced ServerState, which is used to prohibit request processing when a service is not completely ready. This avoids some race conditions, mostly during shutdown. Possible fix for #327.
* discovery.watchService will now fire an available event if the service is available when called. This simplifies a lot of situations where this is done by the caller.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Fix the flaky permission tests


## 2.0.0-rc.11

### Fixed Bugs

* Log level from command line is propagated to sync server.
* Public and private key from the command line are used by the server.


## 2.0.0-rc.10

### Enhancements

* Added register argument to server.getSyncedRealm. This ensures that the
  SyncedRealm is not persisted in the cache.

### Fixed Bugs

* Ensure that services that require SyncedRealms have all required data before
  serving requests


## 2.0.0.rc9

### Breaking changes

  form.

### Enhancements
* Added the agreement to license email step for the BasicServer

### Fixed bugs
* SyncProxyService: Fixed an issue when using sharded sync workers
* Fixed the issue when a synced realm used internally would be undefined or
  invalidated because of sync worker unavailability.

### Internals

* Changed the SyncedRealm class to return a Promise<Realm>. Once it resolves,
  the Realm is there, with valid syncSession which does not get destroyed when
  the sync worker fails over. It utilizes the new override_server() API to
  make the session reconnect to the new sync worker.
* Fixed all the other parts of ROS which use SyncedRealm. Some functions become
  async because of that.
* Changed the way the server starts and stops. Now there is no barrier between
  starting services and registering them. This is required, because now some
  services, in order to start, wait for the Sync service to register.
* Update JS to RC22 and Sync to 2.0.2
* Updated the schema for `/__wildcardpermissions` to match the `/~/__permission` Realms, using `userId = *` for these `Permission` objects.

## 2.0.0-rc.6

### Fixed bugs
* Fixed a bug in HTTPS support (sync proxy) [\#512](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/512)

  name in it is now just `Permission` instead of `StarSpecificPermission`.
* All users now have read-only access to `__wildcardpermissions` on startup [\#431](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/431)
* Grantor permission are reflected [\#491](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/491) and [\#427](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/427)
* If attempting to change permissions with a metadata value matching no users, an error is thrown instead of stalling forever.
